            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>American Development for Africa is in support of the diversity initiative for the United States, and is
                consistent with the commitment to using free market and fair trade solutions to raise the living
                standard for African Americans at home, but further, to establish, promote, and nurture American
                influence among emergent post colonial democracies within the African continent..</p>
            <h2>Energy</h2>
            <img src="img/energy.PNG" alt="energy drill" style="border-radius : 10%; margin-bottom:5%;">
            <p>Offshore drilling operation
                Whereas African nations are rife with abundant sources of energy, the United States is world renowned
                for its industrial ability to capture, extract and harness it.
                ADA has partnerships with world leaders in energy producing technologies who are eager to establish
                African markets for the technologies that power America. From nuclear power plants to drilling rigs and
                refineries, ADA is the premiere resource for Africa to exploit American efficiency and quality of
                design.
                As African and Caribbean governments continue to engage in the privatization of their energy sectors,
                ADA’s body of investors are equally wiling to finance Africa’s modernization and expansion of
                dependable power. Prospects in bio-fuels, hydroelectricity, natural gas and other alternative energy
                sources also await investment.

            <h3>Agriculture</h3>
            <p>The 21st Century is destined to usher in a new era of African advancement across the gamut of human
                endeavors; like all other periods of renaissance and expansion of human capital, there is none other as
                necessary component than nutrition.
                American Development for Africa has formed in order to facilitate speedy and effective transitions to
                agricultural technologies that eliminate malnutrition and food shortages; ultimately, generating
                substantial profits for nations who acquire American machinery.

            <h3>Beyond</h3>
            <p>In line with the United Nations development goal number 17: “Revitalize the global partnership for
                sustainable development”, ADA was established to facilitate enhanced partnership between the United
                States private sector and Countries in the African region. While official development assistance from
                US Government agencies and financial intervention from multilateral development financial instutions
                are still essential, sustainable development hinges on the ability of African countries to develop
                local capacity to drive economic growth from within.
                ADA intends to tap into our vast network of American corporate, institutional and private investors to
                increase foreign direct investment (FDI), as well as technical collaboration and knowledge exchange
                programs geared towards contributing to sustainable economic growth within the African region.
                Our Approach is to connect American businesses and investors with opportunities in Africa with a focus
                on the following sectors:

                <h3>Mining</h3>
                <p>Like energy and agriculture, the extraction of mineral wealth is best accomplished by leveraging the
                    technological and industrial might of the United States. This is especially relevant for the most
                    mineral rich continent on planet Earth, and American industrialists have taken notice..</p>
                <p>ADA partners with American Mining Industry for Africa
                    ADA investors and industrialists alike have a keen interest in establishing “win-win” partnerships
                    with state and private concerns. Nations with an interest in increasing the net yield of their
                    mineral extraction operations while minimizing the impact on the environment are the preferred
                    customer for American mining manufacturers.
                    From technologies used in geological surveys, to excavators, to sorting and refining, ADA
                    partnerships with American industry leaders are strategically developed such that mining operations
                    are accurate, efficient, and deliver maximum tonnage of commodities to market at greater speeds
                    than are available from US competitors.

                <p>American Development for Africa
                    Much of Sub-Saharan Africa over the last two decades, has established impressive economic growth.
                    This can be evidenced by several factors, including the IMF’s upgrading of several Countries in the
                    region, such as Botswana, Ghana, Kenya, Mozambique, Nigeria, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia to the
                    rank of “emerging markets”. With an exponentially expanding middle class, high economic growth
                    rates, stable political environment in most Countries, and a sustained, robust youth population,
                    the African continent has a unique opportunity to overcome its age-old developmental challenges.

                    .</p>
                <p>Despite the impressive progress, several challenges persist as Africa still has the highest
                    concentration of people living below the global poverty line; which in turn, perpetuates the
                    economic and infrastructure gaps that continue to prevent the continent from reaching its full
                    potential. Nevertheless, these gaps create the opportunity for the private sector’s expansion and
                    participation in Africa’s development</p>
